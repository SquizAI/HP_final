## Executive Summary
This ${tone} implementation plan addresses "${problem}" through a structured approach based on "${idea.description}". 

## Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4)
- **Week 1-2:** Conduct stakeholder analysis and form a cross-functional implementation team
- **Week 3:** Develop detailed requirements and success metrics
- **Week 4:** Create resource allocation plan and secure necessary approvals

## Phase 2: Development (Weeks 5-12)
- **Weeks 5-6:** Design detailed solution architecture
- **Weeks 7-9:** Develop core components through iterative sprints
- **Weeks 10-12:** Integrate components and conduct initial testing

## Phase 3: Implementation (Weeks 13-16)
- **Week 13:** Conduct user training and prepare support materials
- **Week 14:** Implement pilot with selected users/departments
- **Weeks 15-16:** Gather feedback and make necessary adjustments

## Phase 4: Scaling & Optimization (Weeks 17-24)
- **Weeks 17-18:** Roll out to all users/departments
- **Weeks 19-20:** Monitor performance and address emerging issues
- **Weeks 21-24:** Optimize based on usage data and stakeholder feedback

## Resource Requirements
- **Team:** Project manager, subject matter experts from key departments, technical implementation specialists
- **Budget:** Estimated $XX,XXX (detailed breakdown available in appendix)
- **Tools:** Project management software, collaboration platform, specialized tools for implementation

## Risk Management
| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy |
|------|--------|------------|---------------------|
| Stakeholder resistance | High | Medium | Early involvement, clear communication of benefits |
| Resource constraints | Medium | Medium | Phased implementation, prioritization of components |
| Technical challenges | Medium | Low | Proof of concept testing, expert consultation |

## Success Metrics
- **Short-term:** Successful completion of all phases within timeline
- **Medium-term:** [Specific metrics related to problem]
- **Long-term:** [Broader organizational benefits]

## Conclusion
This implementation plan provides a structured, ${tone} approach to addressing "${problem}" that balances thoroughness with practicality. The phased approach allows for adjustments as necessary while maintaining momentum toward the solution.
