# Privacy Guardian Sample Images

This directory should contain the following sample images for the Privacy Guardian challenge:

1. `group-meeting.jpg` - An image of a group meeting/team setting with multiple people
2. `portrait.jpg` - A portrait image of a person
3. `friends.jpg` - An image of friends taking a selfie or group photo
4. `meeting.jpg` - A business meeting image with visible faces

## Important Notes

- These images should be royalty-free and comply with licensing requirements
- Images should be relatively small in size (recommended < 500KB each)
- For the face detection to work properly, faces should be clearly visible and of reasonable size
- Place the images directly in this directory

## Alternatives

If you don't have access to these specific images, you can:

1. Use your own images with similar content
2. Download royalty-free images from sources like Unsplash, Pexels, or Pixabay and save them with the specified names
3. Modify the `SAMPLE_IMAGES` array in `PrivacyGuardianMain.tsx` to use your own image paths

For testing purposes, you can also use the "Upload" feature in the application instead of relying on the sample images.
